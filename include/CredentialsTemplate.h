 * IMPORTANT! Please follow the instructions in this file before
 * you try to compile the project for the first time. This file
 * is just a template, don't change the contents of this file.
 * 
 * You need to do the following:
 * 1. Save this file as Credentials.h in include/ directory and
 *    than close this file
 * 2. Open Credentials.h file and enter your WiFi credentials 
 * 3. Save this file and compile and upload the project in debug
 *    mode to check if everything works as it should
 * 
 * Credentials.h is ignored by Git (check the contents of .gitignore
 * file to confirm), so this way your credentials will be kept in
 * your local version of the project. This way you can change the 
 * project and publish your changes on Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket or
 * your own Git server without leaking sensitive information.
